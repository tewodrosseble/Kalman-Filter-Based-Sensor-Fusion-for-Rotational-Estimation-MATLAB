# Kalman-Filter-Based-Sensor-Fusion-for-Rotational-Estimation-MATLAB
This project demonstrates a real-time angle estimation system using sensor fusion techniques to combine data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a rotary encoder. A Kalman filter is implemented in MATLAB to fuse gyroscope and accelerometer data, compensating for drift and noise to achieve accurate, smooth angle tracking
